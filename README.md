# My own nvim config

**Use as is**

## Current system settings and installed tools

    - MacOS
    - Alacritty
    - homebrew
    - Nerd Fonts
    - Nodejs
    - Python / pip


## To install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drjchris/nvim-config.git $HOME/.config/nvim
```

Then run nvim. Loads of things will need to be installed for it to work properly.

## To restart all configs

This will rename all the nvim directories so you can start from fresh

```bash
mv $HOME/.config/nvim $HOME/.config/nvim.backup
mv $HOME/.local/share/nvim $HOME/.local/share/nvim.backup
mv $HOME/.local/state/nvim $HOME/.local/state/nvim.backup
```
